#War

It is everyone's favorite card game, war! Now with improved graphics and 10x the performance(__not true__)

__To Play:__
`ruby bin/game.rb`


I have gone through and cleaned up the code considerably from what we wrote in class. I encourage you to look through it and figure out how it all works.
Do you see any places where I am validating the Single Responsibility Principle?
Are there any areas where I could use another method to DRY up my code?


__Valuable Lessons in this project:__
* Using Emojiis in Ruby üëç
* Using the 'backtick' operator to run the command line tool `say`
* Printing an ascii playing card found on the internet
* Using multiple ruby classes together.
* Learning about ruby's `to_s` method and how that works with our Player class
* Learning about ruby's `sleep` method to pause code execution
* Using descriptive naming so we know when a method is going to print for us or return a value for us to print.
