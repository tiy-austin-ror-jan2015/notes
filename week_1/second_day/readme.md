##HOMEWORK
- Read: https://github.com/styleguide/ruby
  - __All homework assignments must now comply to the ruby style guide__
- Create a new repository on your computer in your `second_day` folder and push that to github. Make sure your Quiz and Number Guessing game assignments are in that repository and pushed to github.
  - __All homework assignments must now be pushed to github to be considered 'turned in'__
- Complete quiz program from class if not already finished. This quiz program should contain a minimum of 5 questions with 4 possible answers to each. The program should ask each question in order and allow me the user to pick one of the multiple choice answers. My final score should be displayed after as a percentage along with the total number correct out of the total.
- Create a number guessing game. Game should pick a random number between 1 and 100 and ask you for a guess. If the guess is less than the number, inform the user and let them guess again. If the guess is greater than the number, inform the user and let them guess again. If the guess is correct, inform the user and quit.
  - Bonus: write the opposite program: you, the user, pick a number between 1 and 100. The computer has to guess the number. You tell it whether it's too high, too low, or right on after each guess. The computer gets five guesses.'
